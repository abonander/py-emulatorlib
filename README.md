py-emulatorlib
==============

A Python 3 wrapper for the telnet commands exposed by the Android emulator, py-emulatorlib facilitates easy development of scripted tests for functions that deal with telephony (calls, SMS, network state), location services (GPS), hardware events such as battery levels, and port redirection.

This library is designed to expose commands documented in the following Android Developer Guide:

Not all commands are implemented yet. Contributions are certainly welcome.
